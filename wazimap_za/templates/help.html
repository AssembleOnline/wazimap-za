            <p>The "Average annual household income" and "Monthly income" figures are only an estimate and should be used with care. You can compare
            them between two places to get a general idea of how income differs, but don't rely on it as an accurate
            indicator of disposable income.</p>

            <p>We calculate the figure by finding the median income band, and then using the middle of that band's income. For example, if the median income band is "R153 801 - R307 600", then we use R230 700 as the average household income. The median income band is the band at which the incomes of half of households are at or below.</p>
