            <h3 id="faq-average-hh-income">How can I use the "Average annual household income" and "Monthly income" figures?</h3>
            <p>The "Average annual household income" and "Monthly income" figures are only an estimate and should be used with care. You can compare
            them between two places to get a general idea of how income differs, but don't rely on it as an accurate
            indicator of disposable income.</p>

            <p>We calculate the figure by finding the median income band, and then using the middle of that band's income. For example, if the median income band is "R153 801 - R307 600", then we use R230 700 as the average household income. The median income band is the band at which the incomes of half of households are at or below.</p>

            <h3 id="faq-2011">Why is the data from 2011?</h3>
            <p>Most of the {{ WAZIMAP.name }} data is from the 2011 Census conducted by <a href="http://www.statssa.gov.za/">Stats SA</a>. A full census is only conducted every 10 years. The <a href="http://cs2016.statssa.gov.za/">Community Survey 2016</a> has additional data and we're looking at how to make it available in {{ WAZIMAP.name }}. The Community Survey data is not available at ward level and is not as comprehensive as the 2011 Census.</p>
